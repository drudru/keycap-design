Links to resources for Keycap Design


My initial goal was to find out if keycap designers were using a template for all the nice GMK keysets that people render.
I wanted to then use that template for my own WASD keycap design. I never did find that 'one template', but I did find a lot of
interesting information. Hopefully the information I share here will save some others some time.

All of these resources should be open/free to use. Send a pull request if you think something should be added here. :thumbs-up:

## Important People

Dakota Felder - https://www.dakotafelder.com/ - he was nice enough to share some great resources below.

hineybush - https://github.com/hineybush/ -  he is pretty well known in the geekhack keyboard community

## GMK / Cherry Legends

Open Cherry Font - https://github.com/dakotafelder/open-cherry
This is the font that people typically see on a GMK render.
Note: it doesn't have the symbols for the modifiers (Shift, Tab, etc.)

If you need a WASD template for the vintage Cherry legends. That is available in this repo as
vintage_cherry.pdf. You can easily import this into inkscape.

## Gorton Legends

Open Gorton https://github.com/dakotafelder/open-gorton
An open-source font based on Signature Plastics' Gorton Modified. Made for the keycap designer community.


## Keycap Rendering

https://www.dakotafelder.com/keycap-designer-resources
This is a set of blender files that are a **fantastic** resource for doing a base kit render.
He used to have a render in a board, but he took that down.

https://www.reddit.com/r/keycapdesigners/comments/dzg7rb/heres_a_2_minute_tutorial_on_how_to_render/
This is a nice short tutorial on how to use the dakota felder blender templates by Mr. Felder himself.


https://github.com/hineybush/CherryMX
These are not in blender, so the software
to read these in is $$. A lot of people point at this for renders, so I link to it here.

## Some Nice WASD Templates
